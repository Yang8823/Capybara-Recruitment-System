Sample Science, Computer Science and Engineering Resumes
This document offers several examples of resumes for science, engineering, or computer science
opportunities. Note that the information provided, the categories used, and the language style in
each example varies based upon field/discipline and specific job or internship opportunities.
When applying to technical Research Assistant positions or similar roles, an extended resume or
Curriculum Vitae (CV) may be appropriate, provided you have sufficient relevant experience to fill
more than 1 page. A CV should prioritize information about your publications, presentations,
research experience, and technical skills. Review the CVs of researchers or faculty you admire or seek
to work with (generally available online), as these often provide good examples to follow.
We encourage applicants to partner every resume or CV with a brief cover letter to provide a
prospective employer with important context for your experiences (particularly your research work)
and to communicate your interest and familiarity with the specific opportunity.
Connect with the Lazarus Center for Career Development for assistance with your resumes, cover
letters, or any aspect of your search. To schedule an appointment with a Career Adviser, contact us
